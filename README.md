# Config

**This is a WIP. install.sh needs cleaning up. I maybe I should split that file up**

**Config** is inspired by [Mark Otto's Config repo](https://github.com/mdo/config/). Running `install.sh` should apply system preferences, Sublime Text preferences, install dev tools, and more.

## Contents

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.bash_profile` | Customizes the Terminal.app |
| `.gitconfig` | Global Git configuration to specify my name and email, shortcuts, colors, and more. |
| `hosts` | Directs `http://tmp.dev` to a local folder |


## Before you start

1. Install SSH keys

2. [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) is **required**. [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) should be installed **after** running install.sh


## Yet to be automated

- `~/.bash_profile`
- `/etc/hosts`
- Prep Terminal.app from Mark Otto's Config repo
- PHP Install Instructions https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-sierra-apache-multiple-php-versions


## Manual Install Instructions

### Rails
I need to know more about if I can install multiple versions of rails "globally" before automating this.
